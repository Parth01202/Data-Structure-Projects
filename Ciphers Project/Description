### Ciphers Project Description

The **Ciphers Project** focuses on the implementation, analysis, and application of various cryptographic ciphers in a practical programming environment. This project introduces students to the fundamentals of encryption and decryption techniques used in secure communications. The project’s objective is to gain hands-on experience in implementing and testing both classical and modern ciphers, understanding their underlying principles, and analyzing their strengths and weaknesses.

#### **Key Objectives:**
1. **Understand Cryptographic Techniques:**
   - Explore the theory behind symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods.
   - Study the mathematical foundations of cryptography, including modular arithmetic, prime numbers, and key generation.

2. **Implement Ciphers:**
   - Write programs for classical ciphers such as:
     - **Caesar Cipher**: A substitution cipher that shifts characters by a specified number.
     - **Vigenère Cipher**: A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword for encryption.
     - **Playfair Cipher**: A digraph substitution cipher using a key matrix.
   - Develop programs for modern cryptographic algorithms:
     - **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: A symmetric block cipher for secure data encryption.
     - **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)**: An asymmetric encryption method using public and private keys.

3. **Analyze Security Strengths:**
   - Compare the robustness of classical versus modern ciphers.
   - Investigate vulnerabilities such as frequency analysis, brute force attacks, and key length limitations.

4. **Apply Ciphers in Real-World Scenarios:**
   - Use ciphers to encrypt and decrypt files, messages, or data streams.
   - Simulate secure communication between two parties using implemented encryption methods.

5. **Optimize Code for Performance:**
   - Ensure efficient key generation, encryption, and decryption processes.
   - Test the scalability of algorithms with varying data sizes and key lengths.
