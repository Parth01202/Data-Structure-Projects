### Description of Your Search Project

The **Search Project** implements a basic text-based search engine using the C++ programming language. The project leverages a combination of tokenization, inverted indexing, and set operations to process and match user queries against a database of text documents. It focuses on providing a robust, efficient, and user-friendly interface for retrieving relevant information.

#### **Features:**

1. **Text Cleaning and Tokenization:**
   - Removes leading and trailing punctuation.
   - Converts all text to lowercase for case-insensitive matching.
   - Discards non-alphabetic characters unless part of a valid token.
   - Ensures only meaningful words are indexed for search.

2. **Inverted Index Construction:**
   - Reads a file containing pairs of URLs and corresponding content.
   - Extracts unique, cleaned tokens from the content.
   - Maps tokens to a set of URLs where they appear.
   - Provides efficient data retrieval by associating each word with its respective documents.

3. **Search Query Processing:**
   - Supports various types of queries:
     - **Simple Queries:** Retrieves all pages containing a given word.
     - **Union Queries:** Combines results for multiple words (e.g., "cat dog").
     - **Intersection Queries:** Finds pages containing all specified words using the `+` prefix (e.g., "+cat +dog").
     - **Negation Queries:** Excludes pages containing specified words using the `-` prefix (e.g., "cat -dog").
   - Performs set operations like union, intersection, and difference to refine results dynamically.

4. **Interactive Command Loop:**
   - Accepts user input queries repeatedly until the user chooses to quit.
   - Displays the number of matching pages and their URLs.
   - Handles invalid or empty input gracefully.

#### **How It Works:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - The `cleanToken` function ensures that each token is cleaned and standardized before being indexed or searched.

2. **Indexing:**
   - The `buildIndex` function reads the input file, tokenizes the content, and constructs the inverted index.
   - Each unique term is associated with a set of URLs, ensuring efficient lookup.

3. **Query Matching:**
   - The `findQueryMatches` function processes user queries by:
     - Cleaning tokens in the query string.
     - Using set operations to combine, intersect, or exclude results based on query syntax.

4. **User Interaction:**
   - The `searchEngine` function orchestrates the interaction loop, allowing users to enter queries and view matching results or exit the program.

#### **Key Algorithms and Concepts:**
- **Inverted Index:** Efficiently maps terms to the URLs where they appear, enabling fast search operations.
- **Set Operations:** Combines results using union, intersection, and difference to handle complex query logic.
- **Tokenization and Cleaning:** Ensures data consistency and eliminates irrelevant or redundant tokens.
- **File I/O:** Processes large datasets stored in files, building an index dynamically.

---

#### **Possible Enhancements:**
- **Partial Matching:** Implement fuzzy matching to handle typos or similar words.
- **Ranking Results:** Introduce a ranking system based on word frequency or page relevance.
- **Wildcard Queries:** Support advanced search syntax with wildcard characters (e.g., "ca*").
- **Performance Optimization:** Use data structures like tries or hash maps for faster indexing and retrieval.
- **Multi-Threading:** Parallelize the indexing process for large datasets.
